                Hello there! üëãüèΩ Welcome to my personal page. I'm a software
                engineer who can write code to check the fuel efficiency of
                rocket fuel in your space rocket during flight time to notify
                you of any possible combustion issues. I can also write code to
                optimize the performance of any hybrid electric vehicle and
                improve the efficiency by 20%. I can also write code to create a
                self learning natural language processing engine that can stay
                with you in your office and learn everything about your business
                to eventually act as a scalable and always available customer
                agent bot.
                <br />
                <br />
                Impressed, eh?
                <br />
                <br />
                No, I can't do any of that. But I can write solid web
                applications with clean testable code, implementing distributed
                architecture on the cloud, efficient APIs and a beautiful UI/UX
                providing your users with the best possible experience. I write
                mostly in the <b>JavaScript</b> stack, utilizing the powers of{" "}
                <b>ReactJS</b>, <b>Node</b> and <b>Express</b>, <b>NestJS</b>,{" "}
                <b>Next.js</b>, etc. And I like doing it the <b>AGILE</b> way!
                <br />
                <br />
                I've have worked across different startups in the US üá∫üá∏ (Chicago
                and New York), wearing all hats and doing frontend, backend,
                infrastructure, moving from EC2 to ElasticBeanstalk, logging,
                CI/CD, scaling up, implementing SCRUM, arranging office desks,
                organizing fun parties, etc. I currently work at more of a scale
                up product company in <b>Melbourne, Australia</b> üá¶üá∫ focusing on
                clean, testable and maintainable code.
                <br />
                <br />I live in suburban Melbourne with my wife Monika and our
